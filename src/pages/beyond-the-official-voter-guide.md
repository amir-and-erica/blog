To many San Francisco residents, election season means a mailbox stuffed with election mailers. Among the glossy campaign ads, one of the only nonpartisan things residents will receive is the official voter guide sent out by City Hall, a booklet of digests, arguments, and definitions of wonky terms for the ballot initiatives. It's a valuable resource that aims to translate legalese into plain English, not unlike By The Bay.

The official voter guide is designed to be usable by every resident in SF ‚Äì not an easy task by any means. But by doing this, the official guide falls short for many, especially those in our audience. Here's where we try to improve upon what you get in the mail.

## We put design first

The official voter guide is primarily a printed booklet. We believe that although that's the most accessible format, it might not be the most approachable.

Our guide is formatted and created primarily for web, so that you can view it from a computer or phone at any point you need to. That enables us to use
* graphics to explain things visually
* images to make things memorable
* color for emphasis and interestingness
* links to allow the reader to dive deeper
* sound, video to bring it to real life
* a variety of page layouts

I have a feeling you might already understand the benefits of webpages over a printed page. By making the information more approachable we hope that it doesn't feel like homework to vote. Understanding the issues requires some effort, and our goal is to make it as effortless as possible. Design is our main tool to do that.

## We keep our guide updated

The Ballot Simplification Committee, a group of five, unpaid members, must finalize the digests that go into the official voter guide [85 days](http://zesty.ca/vstf/sfmec.html#s535) prior to the election. The committee holds [public hearings](https://sfelections.sfgov.org/ballot-simplification-committee-information-%E2%80%93-november-6-2018-consolidated-general-election) to whittle down the language and to address any public comment about the digests. This election, the guide needs to be finalized by August 31, long before a vast majority of residents even hear about the measures.

Having outdated information can be dangerous. In the primary election this year on June 5, we voted on [Prop H](https://archives.bythebay.cool/election/sf-prop-h), which would have enacted a Taser usage policy for the SFPD. After the measure was put into the ballot, the Police Commission passed a Taser usage policy _materially different_ from the one the public was about to vote on. Had Prop H passed, it would have replaced the Police Commission's policy, but the official voter guide did not explain this. Because it had to be printed and mailed by a certain date, it had left out the crux of the decision before the voters.

At By The Bay, we update our guide on a daily basis, giving you news that might affect your understanding and vote ‚Äì just another benefit of a webpage.

## We talk about the whole context

Here's the wild part ‚Äì even if the Police Commission had passed that policy during the period of writing the official voter guide, the Ballot Simplification Committee wouldn't have been able to include it. It can only summarize the information in the proposed initiative. It cannot interpret, predict, or add information.

We explain ballot propositions as if you've never heard of them. This requires context that may not exist in the policy. After all, the policy is written to persuade, not to explain. We're here to explain.

## We assume you're smarter than an 8th grader

The [SF Municipal Elections Code](http://zesty.ca/vstf/sfmec.html#s515) says that the Ballot Simplification Committee shall prepares digests and

> shall achieve the closest proximity to the **eighth grade level** of readability as possible.

(Emphasis added). When you think about the fact that City Hall has to be accessible to all, an 8th grade reading level isn't outlandish. On the flip side, SF (and most of our readers) are highly educated:
* 55% of San Franciscans over 25 have a Bachelor's degree or higher. [[US Census Bureau]](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/sanfranciscocountycalifornia/PST045217)
* 87% have at least a high school education. (That's ostensibly 4 years beyond the requirement!)

At By The Bay, we can speak to you like an adult, using the üçÜ emoji, and using acronyms without fear of losing the reader. We know politics can be really dense, or insider-y, so we do our best to make this interesting for all our adult readers.
