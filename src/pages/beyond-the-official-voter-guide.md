To many residents, election season in San Francisco means a doorknob and mailbox stuffed with election mailers. Among the glossy campaign ads, one of the only nonpartisan things residents will receive is the official voter guide sent out by City Hall, a booklet of digests, arguments, and definitions of wonky terms for the ballot initiatives. It's a valuable resource that aims to translate legalese into plain English, not unlike By The Bay. However, we at By The Bay try to take all the relevant information inside and outside the official guide to give you a more complete understanding of the ballot. Here's where we believe the official voter guide falls short for our audience, and how we address it.

## We're digital first

We're also mobile-first, whereas the official guide is print-first. I don't mean to suggest digital is better than print in all cases. A printed, mailed guide is still the only way to reach all registered voters. You need an address to vote, but not necessarily a computer. The City does publish a version of their official guide online, but does so in nearly an identical format to the printed version.  

We're not the government. We can make some assumptions to better suit a more specific audience. Our guide is formatted and created primarily for web, so that you can view it from a computer or phone whenever you need to. That enables us to use graphics, images, color, links, interactive media, and a variety of layouts to help you better understand the issues at hand.

We've found that our election-coverage is visited the most during the three days before the election. By the time you think about voting, it's possible you've lost the official guide mailed a month earlier. Or perhaps you left it at home. We can solve for these cases.



## We're keep our guide updated

The Ballot Simplification Committee, a group of five, unpaid members, must finalize the digests that go into the official voter guide [85 days](http://zesty.ca/vstf/sfmec.html#s535) prior to the election. The committee holds [public hearings](https://sfelections.sfgov.org/ballot-simplification-committee-information-%E2%80%93-november-6-2018-consolidated-general-election) to whittle down the language and to address any public comment about the digests. Once it's finalized, there's a period for public review and legal challenges. Ballot arguments, which are printed next to the digests, must be submitted by August 21 this year. For ballot measures this year, the guide is finalized August 31, long before a vast majority of residents even hear about the measures.

Having outdated information can be dangerous. In the primary election this year on June 5, we voted on [Prop H](https://archives.bythebay.cool/election/sf-prop-h), which would have enacted a Taser usage policy for the SFPD. After the measure was put into the ballot, the Police Commission (a commission of City Hall) passed a Taser usage policy _materially different_ from the one the public was about to vote on. Had Prop H passed, it would have replaced the Police Commission's policy, but the official voter guide did not explain this. Because it needs to be printed and mailed by a certain date, it had missed and left out the crux of the decision before the voters because its information was out of date.

At By The Bay, we update our guide on a daily basis, giving you news that might affect your understanding and vote.

## We talk about the whole context

Here's the wild part â€“ even if the Police Commission had passed that policy during the period of writing the official voter guide, the Ballot Simplification Committee wouldn't have been able to include it. It can only summarize the information in the proposed initiative. It cannot interpret, predict, or add information.

This was evident when last week, I attended the BSC's public hearings for November's election. An audience member suggested an edit, and the chair of the committee repeatedly claimed that the committee could not include information not already in the proposal. Additional context is left to the ballot arguments.

We explain ballot propositions as if you've never heard of them. This requires context that may not exist in the policy. After all, the policy is written to persuade, not to explain. We're here to explain.

## We assume you're smarter than an 8th grader

The [SF Municipal Elections Code](http://zesty.ca/vstf/sfmec.html#s515) says that the Ballot Simplification Committee shall prepares digests and

> shall achieve the closest proximity to the **eighth grade level** of readability as possible.

(Emphasis added). When you think about the fact that City Hall has to be accessible to all, an 8th grade reading level isn't outlandish. On the flip side, SF is highly educated:
* 55% of San Franciscans over 25 have a Bachelor's degree or higher. [[US Census Bureau]](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/sanfranciscocountycalifornia/PST045217)
* 87% have at least a high school education. (That's ostensibly 4 years beyond the requirement!)

At By The Bay, we tailor our language and jokes for voters under 35 (the damn Millennials). We commend the City's efforts to reach an expansive audience, but we also recognize that many educated, smart professionals are disengaged with local politics. We aim to get those people engaged.


In summary, the official voter guide provides a valuable resource to many, but we believe we can create a better learning experience for our audience. The result is By The Bay.
