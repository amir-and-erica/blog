To many San Francisco residents, election season means a mailbox stuffed with election mailers. Among the glossy campaign ads, one of the only nonpartisan things residents will receive is the official voter guide sent out by City Hall, a booklet of digests, arguments, and definitions of wonky terms for the ballot initiatives. It's a valuable resource that aims to translate legalese into plain English, not unlike By The Bay.

The Ballot Simplification Committee, a group of five, unpaid members, writes the digests that you receive. Last week, I attended the [public hearings](https://sfelections.sfgov.org/ballot-simplification-committee-information-%E2%80%93-november-6-2018-consolidated-general-election) for the writing of the five SF ballot measures to understand the nuances of their word choice, and to see what the process is like. Here's what I found.

## Its members are nominated

The Committee is made up of five San Francisco residents, nominated by various organizations and appointed by the Board of Supervisors and Mayor. They serve two-year terms and are tasked with writing a "fair and impartial summary of each local ballot measure in simple language."

By the City charter,
* Two members must nominated by either the local chapter of _National Academy of Television Arts and Sciences_ or the _Northern California Broadcasters Association_.
* One must be nominated by the _League of Women Voters of San Francisco_.
* One must be nominated by the _Northern California Media Workers Guild_.
* One must be an education reading specialist, recommended by the Superintendent of SF Unified School District.

Even though the committee has five members, only four were in attendance during the hearings. A member from the City Attorney's office was present, only to answer questions and offer guidance in legal matters.

## The digests are written at an 8th grade level

The [SF Municipal Elections Code](http://zesty.ca/vstf/sfmec.html#s515) says that the Ballot Simplification Committee shall prepares digests of 300 words and

> shall achieve the closest proximity to the **eighth grade level** of readability as possible.

(Emphasis added). When you think about the fact that City Hall has to be accessible to all, an 8th grade reading level isn't outlandish. On the flip side, SF (and most of our readers) are highly educated:
* 55% of San Franciscans over 25 have a Bachelor's degree or higher. [[US Census Bureau]](https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/sanfranciscocountycalifornia/PST045217)
* 87% have at least a high school education. (That's ostensibly 4 years beyond the requirement!)

## The guide is finalized by end of August

The Ballot Simplification Committee must finalize the digests that go into the official voter guide [85 days](http://zesty.ca/vstf/sfmec.html#s535) prior to the election. This election, the guide needs to be finalized by August 31, long before a vast majority of residents even hear about the measures.

Having outdated information can be ultimately misleading. In the primary election this year on June 5, we voted on [Prop H](https://archives.bythebay.cool/election/sf-prop-h), which would have enacted a Taser usage policy for the SFPD. After the measure was approved for the ballot, the Police Commission passed a Taser usage policy _materially different_ from the one the public was about to vote on. Had Prop H passed, it would have replaced the Police Commission's policy, but the official voter guide merely mentioned "The [Police] Commission is developing a pol­icy on tasers." When in fact, by the time people voted, the Police Commission had passed a usage policy.

## The Committee can only write about the proposed policy

Here's the wild part – even if the Police Commission had passed that policy during the period of writing the official voter guide, the Ballot Simplification Committee wouldn't have been able to include it. It can only summarize the information in the proposed initiative. It cannot interpret, predict, or add information.

This repeatedly came up during the part of the hearing where those from the public, attending the hearing, could weigh in. A spokesperson for the Libertarian Party of San Francisco made many suggestions that were dismissed because they were not in the legislation. "We are limited in our powers," Committee Chairman Packard explained.

Our goal at By The Bay is to give you everything you need to know to vote. Although we applaud the Ballot Simplification Committee for their important work to explain these complex issues, there is context, opinions, and information we believe would make you more informed on Election Day.
