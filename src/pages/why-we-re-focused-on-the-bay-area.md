There are a lot of reasons why Yvonne and I started By The Bay in the Bay: We both live in SF and we received a grant to create a voter guide for San Jose, but here's why our post-rationalization makes sense.

## The SF ballot has so many propositions

SF has a particularly confusing ballot, thanks to the number of propositions on it. The gravity of some of the policy left up to us, the voters, is also astounding, making it all the more important that we help people fully understand what they're voting on.

In 2016, California had 17 state ballot propositions, some [silly](https://original.ballot.fyi/60/), but all pretty important. SF had 25 county propositions, making a total of 42 ballot initiatives San Franciscans had to vote on.

For the June election this year, a _midterm primary_ election, San Franciscans had to vote on 15 ballot initiatives total.

California loves its direct democracy, and San Francisco doubles down on it, making SF voters' ballot jam-packed with policy decisions. As a result, the need for an accessible, nonpartisan voter guide is more urgent than in other parts of the country.

## Florida, also confusing

### (A quick aside)
Number of ballot initiatives is one proxy to measure how confusing a ballot is, but there's one other state that makes the ballot more cumbersome. It's my home and always-abnormal state of Florida. 

Because Florida has a committee that can refer constitutional amendments, it refers initiatives that have _multiple_ policies bundled together. For example, this November, Floridians will vote on whether they want ban offshore drilling _and_ vaping in indoor workplaces, in one initiative. Floridians can only vote Yes or No for [this](https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Amendment_9,_Ban_Offshore_Oil_and_Gas_Drilling_and_Ban_Vaping_in_Enclosed_Indoor_Workplaces_Amendment_(2018)), enacting both or none of it.

I mention all this because we know that other places desperately need better materials to quickly understand their ballot. We're starting in SF and California, but our goal is to eventually expand to other states and cities.

## The political appetite in SF is hangry

If we're going to make a site that talks about local politics, we need an audience that cares about the topic, or at least _wants_ to care. SF is v woke, and the 2016 election has led to greater discussion of politics. In a majority blue city, people are particularly ready to take action.

## A lack of local political coverage

The state of media is not good. There's little investment in news, which results in less coverage around important topics. Trust in media is at an all-time low. Journalism as a business is struggling because Google and Facebook are taking the lion's share of ad revenue. And people don't care what they don't know about. 

We're starting in SF because it's needed.

We've been trying lots of ways to expand how people get local information. The idea is if it works here, a place where it's most likely to work, we can then start expanding to new cities and states.
