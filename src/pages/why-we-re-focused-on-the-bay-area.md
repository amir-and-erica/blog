Yvonne and I both live in SF, so we naturally started By The Bay here. But hear our rationalization out â€“ it makes sense. 

## SF has the most ballot propositions

In 2016, California had 17 state ballot propositions, including legalizing cannabis and repealing the death penalty. SF had 27(?) county propositions, making a total of 54 ballot initiatives we had to vote on. This doesn't include the many people we had to elect into office. In comparison NYC had ?? and LA had ?? total props to vote on. CA loves its direct democracy, and SF doubles down on it.

For June 2018, a _midterm primary_, San Franciscans had to vote on 15 ballot initiatives. For November, there's already 13 state propositions qualified for the ballot + god knows how many in SF.

Looking at other states, there's one other state that's perhaps worse than California. It's my home state of Florida. In terms of number of ballot initiatives it has less, but because Florida has a committee that can refer ballot initiatives, it refers initiatives that have *multiple* pieces of legislation in it. So for example, this fall, Floridians will vote on whether they want [??] *and* [???]. You can only vote Yes or No for this. You enact both parts or none of it. 

## The political appetite in SF is primed

SF is v woke.
