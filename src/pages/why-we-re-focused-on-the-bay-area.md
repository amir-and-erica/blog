There are a lot of reasons why Yvonne and I started By The Bay in the Bay. For starters, we both live in SF and we received a grant to create a voter guide for San Jose, but here's why our post-rationalization makes sense.

## SF has so many ballot propositions 

California loves its direct democracy, and San Francisco doubles down on it. In almost every election cycle, SF's ballot is jam-packed with policy decisions. In 2016, for instance, SF had 25 county propositions, and CA had 17 propositions, which meant San Franciscans had to vote on a total of 42 ballot initiatives, _not_ including contested races.

This past June, San Franciscans had to vote on 15 ballot initiatives and five statewide ballot propositions, which isn't bad for a midterm primary election, but it was a _midterm primary election_. After we launched ballot.fyi, we realized the need for an accessible, nonpartisan voter guide is more critical in the Bay Area than in other parts of the country.

## CA isn't alone. Florida is also confusing. (A quick aside)

The number of ballot initiatives in an election is one proxy to measure how confusing the ballot is, but there's one other state that makes the ballot more cumbersome: my home and always-abnormal state of Florida. 

Since Florida has a committee that can refer constitutional amendments, it also refers initiatives that have _multiple_ policies bundled together. For example, this November, Floridians will vote on whether they want to ban offshore drilling _and_ vaping in indoor workplaces, in one initiative. Floridians can only vote Yes or No for [the proposition](https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Amendment_9,_Ban_Offshore_Oil_and_Gas_Drilling_and_Ban_Vaping_in_Enclosed_Indoor_Workplaces_Amendment_(2018)), enacting both or neither one.

I mention all this because we know that other places need concise, nonpartisan election information too. We started in SF and CA, but our goal is to expand to other cities and states. 

Also, Florida needs some loving.

## The political appetite in SF is hangry

If we're going to make a site about local politics, we need an audience that cares about the topic, or at least _wants_ to care. SF is v woke, and the 2016 election has led to more discussion and awareness of national politics.

## A lack of local political coverage

The state of media is not great. Newsrooms are [shrinking](http://www.journalism.org/fact-sheet/newspapers/). How we trust media and information is [constantly analyzed](https://digiday.com/media/global-state-trust-media-5-charts/) and [very nuanced](https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/magazine/polls-show-americans-distrust-the-media-but-talk-to-them-and-its-a-very-different-story/2017/12/27/ed9bbabe-ce3b-11e7-81bc-c55a220c8cbe_story.html). Journalism as a business is [struggling](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/jul/17/news-industry-revenue-declines-biggest-threat-to-journalism) because Google and Facebook are taking the lion's share of ad revenue. And people generally won't care about what they don't know about. 

We started in SF because it's needed.

We've been trying lots of ways to expand how people get local information. The idea is if it works here, a place where it's most likely to work, we can then start expanding to new cities and states.
