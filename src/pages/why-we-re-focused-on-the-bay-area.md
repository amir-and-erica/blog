Yvonne and I both live in SF, so naturally, we started By The Bay here. But hear our post-rationalization out â€“ it makes sense.

## SF has the most ballot propositions [<-fact check]

In 2016, California had 17 state ballot propositions, some [silly](https://original.ballot.fyi/60/), but all pretty important. SF had 25 county propositions, making a total of 42 ballot initiatives San Franciscans had to vote on in 2016. This doesn't include the many candidates running for office, or the lack of media attention on anything down ballot. In comparison, NY had zero and LA had at least 23 total props to vote on.

For the June election this year, a _midterm primary_ election, San Franciscans had to vote on 15 ballot initiatives total. For November, there's already 11 state propositions qualified for the ballot, and SF is TBD.

California loves its direct democracy, and San Francisco doubles down on it.

## Florida makes it more confusing

California, in terms of quantity has the most props this year, but there's one other state that's perhaps more cumbersome. It's my home and always-abnormal state of Florida. Because Florida has a committee that can refer constitutional amendments, it refers initiatives that have *multiple* policies bundled together. For example, this November, Floridians will vote on whether they want ban offshore drilling *and* vaping in indoor workplaces, in one initiative. Floridians can only vote Yes or No for [this](https://ballotpedia.org/Florida_Amendment_9,_Ban_Offshore_Oil_and_Gas_Drilling_and_Ban_Vaping_in_Enclosed_Indoor_Workplaces_Amendment_(2018)), enacting both or none of it.

Californians can complain about the length of their ballot, but at least they can vote on issues separately (most of the time).

## The political appetite in SF is hangry

If we're going to make a site that talks local politics, we need an audience that cares about the topic, or at least _wants_ to care. SF is v woke, and unsurprisingly blue thanks to national politics. Because it's so homogenous, I suspect people are more likely to broach the topic of politics. It can be dangerous, but you can often assume that the person you're talking to is liberal.

Also, San Franciscans seem ready and willing to try a new service if it helps solve a problem.

We've been trying lots of ways to expand how people get local information. The idea is if it works here, the place most likely to work, we can then start expanding to new cities and states.
