## Thesis
Our mission is to turn residents into citizens. We do that through education. Namely, we explain complex topics that can be incredibly dry into web pages that help you vote. We're an information resource, but like everybody else, we're also a web app in 2018. Design matters, especially in a space typically absent of it. Here's how we think about how design helps you vote.

## State of web's art

This is not meant to be a critique about the current state of web design, but more why it doesn't make sense for what we're doing.
If you ever want to see why websites all look the same, check out Dribbble, a platform where designers upload their designs. It's turned into the zeitgeist of modern (aka silicon valley) web design, and you can quickly see the kind of aesthetic that dominates many websites. Keep in mind that many of the designers are employees of a company, so the work they put out is often in service of creating sites for selling SaaS and enterprise software.  

If I were to put it into words the current aesthetic cherishes isomorphic, paper-like pictograms + large gradients. Here are some examples of that diagonal across the landing page

The trap is real. To look modern, you have to look like the coolest sites out there, but that may not be what's most appropriate for users

## Inspiration
modern web design
Donut shops -> bright and spirited
 - tim horton's site
 - another object-oriented site
newspapers -> informational
memphis design -> 90s as nostalgic absurdity

## actual design treatment
fonts -> abril fatface, georgia
colors -> colorful, but mostly solid
represent things as objects
