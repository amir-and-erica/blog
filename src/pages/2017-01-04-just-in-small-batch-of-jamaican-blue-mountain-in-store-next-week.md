  People have asked us "Why did you launch a local media company that's
  nonpartisan? Wouldn't it be easier to reach an audience with a conservative or
  liberal point of view?" Sure, maybe so, but for us, the answer is simple:
  We're nonpartisan because we're optimists.

## What does 'nonpartisan' mean?

"Nonpartisan" is a loaded term in journalism that's often blurred with [objectivity and impartiality](http://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/). Many people will argue it's impossible to be truly nonpartisan. At By The Bay, we define being nonpartisan as "attempting to accurately and fairly represent a multitude of perspectives." 

We recognize not all opinions are equal and we do our best to reflect the truth by making our reporting and editorial processes as transparent as possible.

## But everyone has a point of view. Don't you?

It's true, we do. We live in SF. We've been covering CA and SF politics for the past year, not for the past decade. Jimmy and I share a dry, sarcastic, occasionally cheesy sense of humor, and we're not afraid to express our personality in our work. 

That being said, there's a difference between having a perspective and fairly representing other perspectives. We spend countless hours researching opposing arguments and opposing-opposing arguments so we can accurately explain them to you. As a media company, we don't attempt to adjudicate. We want to present complex information in a fun, interesting way, and motivate you to get involved (aka vote!).

## What's optimism got to do with it?

I will never forget the shock I felt the night of the 2016 US presidential election. It was the first of many existential cracks in my social media echo chamber. I felt disempowered from the political process and disenchanted by national news. I kept asking myself, "How did I not see this coming?" 

Since then, I've come to realize that being nonpartisan isn't neutral. It's loaded with optimism. It's fueled by the belief that we can inspire people to act if we can help them understand complex and often contradictory sides to an issue. It's realizing that the pursuit of the truth, or journalism, is never-ending. We strive to examine and challenge what we claim to know because in all honesty, we don't know much. But our commitment to never stop trying.
