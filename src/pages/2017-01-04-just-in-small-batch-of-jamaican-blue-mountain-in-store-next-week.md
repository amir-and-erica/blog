  People have asked us "Why did you launch a local media company that's
  nonpartisan? Wouldn't it be easier to reach an audience with a conservative or
  liberal point of view?" Sure, maybe so, but for us, the answer is simple:
  We're nonpartisan because we're optimists.

## What does 'nonpartisan' mean?

"Nonpartisan" is a loaded term in journalism that's often blurred with [objectivity and impartiality](http://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/). Many people say it's impossible to be truly nonpartisan. At By The Bay, we define being nonpartisan as "attempting to accurately and fairly represent a multitude of perspectives." 

We recognize not all opinions are equal and we do our best to reflect the truth by making our reporting and editorial processes as transparent as possible.

## But everyone has a point of view. Don't you?

It's true, we do. We live in SF. We've been covering CA and SF politics for the past year, not for the past decade. Jimmy and I share a dry, sarcastic, occasionally cheesy sense of humor, and we're not afraid to express our personality in our work. 

That being said, there's a difference between having a perspective and fairly representing other perspectives. We spend countless hours researching opposing arguments and opposing-opposing arguments so we can accurately explain them to you. As a media company, we don't attempt to adjudicate. We want to present complex information in an easy to understand way, and empower you to get involved (aka vote!).

## What's optimism got to do with it?

Well, I'll never forget the shock I felt the night of the 2016 US Presidential election. It was the first of many existential cracks in my social media echo chamber. I felt disenchanted by national news, and as a result, disempowered from the political process. I kept asking myself, "How did I not see this coming?" 

Since then, I've come to understand that being nonpartisan isn't neutral; It's loaded with optimism. We're fueled by the belief that we can inspire people to act, vote, be a better citizen if we can help them understand complex and often contradictory sides to important issues. 

At By The Bay, we recognize the pursuit of the truth, aka journalism, is never-ending. We're relentlessly challenging and investigating what we think we know because, to be honest, we don't know much. Our mission is to learn and make it easier for you to join our journey. 

We hope you will.
