## What does 'nonpartisan' mean?

"Nonpartisan" has become a controversial, confusing term in journalism. The word is often blurred with "[objectivity" and "impartiality](http://pressthink.org/2010/11/the-view-from-nowhere-questions-and-answers/)." Many people argue it isn't possible to be nonpartisan, everyone has a point of view. At By The Bay, we define nonpartisan as "attempting to accurately and fairly represent a multitude of perspectives." 

We recognize not all opinions are equal (i.e. I believe in aliens vs. I believe in gravity) and we can't describe every single point of view that ever existed. Our mission is to help you understand dense, seemingly impenetrable topics, like local politics. 

## Your nonpartisan with a point of view? 

Absolutely, we have a perspective. For instance, Jimmy and I live in SF. We've been covering CA and SF politics for the past year (not the past decade). We share a dry, occasionally cheesy sense of humor, and we're not afraid to express our personality in our work. 

That being said, there's a difference between describing a singular perspective and striving to represent a variety of perspectives. We're committed to the latter. Jimmy and I spend countless hours researching opposing arguments and opposing-opposing arguments so we can confidently explain them. As a media company, we don't attempt to adjudicate. Our goal is to present complex information in a useful, easy-to-understand way so you feel empowered to act, aka vote.

## What does optimism have to do with it?

Well, I'll never forget my shock the night of the 2016 US Presidential election. My inability to anticipate the results revealed one of many existential cracks in my social media echo chamber. For months, I felt disenchanted by national news stories and disempowered from the political process. I kept asking myself, "How did I not see this coming? Why was I so surprised?" 

After nearly a year of ruminating, I've come to realize that nonpartisan isn't neutral. Rather, it's loaded with optimism. We believe explaining complex, often contradictory sides to important issues inspires people to act, vote, and be a responsible citizen. With fair and accurate reporting, we hope no one will be caught off guard by life-changing election results (like me).   

At By The Bay, we recognize the pursuit of truth is never-ending. We relentlessly challenge and investigate what we _think_ we know because, honestly, shhh, we don't know much. Our goal is to learn. And if we do our jobs: researching, writing, creating beautiful local voter guides, it'll be easier for you to learn with us too. 

We hope you will.
